- Task for this assignment was to create a calculator that handles 4 operations and 2 inputs to calcuale a result

- First step we setup the basic server files using previous examples from class and other similar assignments

- Then we checked to make sure the servers and scripts were running, which they were

- Created the basic HTML Form to be parsed into the JS Logic, at first I made it on the client side and then transferred it. Also at this step I found a drop down menu to use for the operators

- Worked with the calculate function logic to take in the string of the operator and then based on that run math based on the inputs. stored into ana rray on server side 

- Setup GET, POST calls to move information to and from server

- Learned how .notation can be used to dive into information packets being transferred
